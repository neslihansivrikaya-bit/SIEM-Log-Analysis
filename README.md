# SIEM Log Analysis Project

### 🔍 Overview
This project demonstrates real-world SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) log analysis techniques using sample attack logs.  
The goal is to identify suspicious activity, brute-force patterns, and security anomalies by analyzing authentication logs.

## 📁 Tools Used
- Splunk (Cloud Free Trial or Local)
- Google Chronicle (optional)
- Linux CLI
- Sample log files (provided)

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Import log files into SIEM  
- Identify repeated failed login attempts  
- Detect brute-force indicators  
- Analyze attacker IP addresses (GeoIP lookup)  
- Document findings in a professional incident report  
- Provide recommendations for mitigation

---

## 🧪 Findings (to be filled after analysis)
- Suspicious authentication anomalies  
- Repeated failures from a single IP  
- Possible brute-force or credential stuffing  
- Geographic origin of attack  
- Recommended defensive actions

## 📄 Deliverables
- 📘 PDF Incident Report  
- 📸 Screenshots of SIEM dashboards  
- 📝 Summary of findings  
- 📁 Log files used for analysis
